# Lab 1. Frozen Lake with DQN

In this task, we successfully developed a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to solve the Frozen Lake environment from OpenAI Gym. We implemented a neural network in PyTorch to approximate the Q-function, set up a training loop with experience replay and an epsilon-greedy policy, and incorporated metrics to track the agent's performance. Custom visualization functions were created for displaying the agent's actions and the environment state within a Jupyter Notebook. Finally, we evaluated the agent's performance by observing its actions, rewards, and overall episode rewards, demonstrating the DQN's learning process and decision-making ability in the Frozen Lake environment.
