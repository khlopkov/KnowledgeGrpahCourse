# Lab #5.

In this lab, the primary focus is on exploring Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a specific emphasis on Node Similarity in graph representations. The task involves:

Conclusions:

1. Training Epochs Impact: Different numbers of training epochs significantly influence the quality of node embeddings and the accuracy of Node Similarity metrics. Both underfitting and overfitting risks are highlighted.

2. Model Selection and Comparison: The effectiveness of different GNN models (HolE, DistMult) in capturing node relationships varies, emphasizing the need for model selection based on specific dataset characteristics.

3. Node Similarity Insights: Visualization and similarity measurements provide insights into how nodes are related within the graph. These methods help in understanding the underlying structure and patterns in the data.

4. Practical Application of Nearest Neighbors: The lab shows how Node Similarity concepts can be applied in practice, such as in finding similar nodes, which is useful in many real-world applications like recommendation systems.
