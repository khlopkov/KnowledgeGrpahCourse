yz near fort sterling like cairn cloatch or pen fenair is best for ore. there are no great spots tho, they are all about the same. you can get more enchanted ores tho if you look on your zone maps there is a percentage there, that indicates the odds of finding enchanted nodes. but... since this is yz, its going to be flooded with players and the higher % zones are going to be more flooded. once you hit t5 you should head to rz. near fs.; ORE_T5
for t5 ore i'd go farm somewhere around fort sterling in t5 maps, where people can't gang you. usually i go for pen fenair or cairn cloatch; ORE_T5
