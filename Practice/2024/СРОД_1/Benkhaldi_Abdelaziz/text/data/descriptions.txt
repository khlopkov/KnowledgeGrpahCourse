hi kids eric the car guy here today we have a 2005 Acura TL I know Eric with another Honda but the principles in this video applied to many many vehicles and situations because this vehicle has what the owner believes to be a suspension noise and I had a lot of requests from you about you know I got a noise that kind of thing well this will help you nail down a suspension noise and that the purpose of this video so the first thing we do if it a customer car of course it your car you already know when the noise happens but you need to get in the car and you need to take it for a drive and see if you can reproduce the noise so we going to drive around and see if we can hear the noise alright one of the first things you want to do is try to identify the type of noise is it a knocking noise it is a squeaking noise it is a squealing noise I mean noises come in all shapes and sizes but they can point you towards a given you know a given component or area to look if you got like maybe say a steering noise like say when you turn the wheel you hear like a rusty hinge kind of noise or maybe hear the belts squealing that kind of thing you can best hear that noise if you just sitting still so start your start your checks by just turning the wheel from side to side and I shut up so you can listen I do hear or feel anything abnormal here when the steering feels a little nope nothing here alright now let drive now the I can hear it a little bit there now the owner says that this noise is coming from the right front no well how how well that microphone is going to pick that up quite a bit annoys there on this bumpy road well we took a trip oh there it is a lot also see how the steering wheel is moving if it moving at lower speeds like that that a tire issue that either a tire wheel something not round is what that is so tires are always suspect always just driving normally I do seem to hear the noise
today in the shop we have a 2001 toyota highlander with 170 000 miles on it and this car came in with some noise wait wait wait wait what are you doing working on a toyota i know it a toyota but like we still have to fix it yeah but you a volkswagen guy you have no idea what you doing on this car i mean yeah like i know we normally work on volkswagens but our man vince has got a broken car we got to take care of it man get this toyota out of here do listen to that guy because in this video we are going to be walking through the process of figuring out where vince noise is coming from and more importantly how to fix it with pretty much any type of noise concern you want to start in one of two places either with a test drive or a visual inspection i usually prefer to do the test drive first so we can at least attempt to isolate where our noise is coming from this also really helps if you have a second person that can drive the car so you can listen to the noise also keep in mind noises can travel throughout the car so a noise that sounds like it coming from the right front may actually be coming from their back on this test drive we want to pay attention to a number of things like when the noise happens and what the car doing when it making the noise are we going over a bump and it making a noise going up or is it making the noise going down a noise on the upside going over a bump is a noise when our suspension is compressing on the downside of the bump that known as the rebound you can also try and jounce the car up and down and replicate the noise while the car standing still this is usually my favorite way especially with someone help because it allows you to move the suspension and do a visual inspection at the same time and luckily this one was pretty easy as you can see the strut looks like it actually coming apart as i move the wheel back and forth you can see where the strut goes into the body it moving a whole bunch so this is definitely the source of at least part of our noise
Owner reached out almost 2 years ago because the local Audi Dealer could not figure out why the ALTERNATOR would not charge the of DOLLARS were spent with no resolution I asked does it charge in mode with the Communication wire unplugged Sure enough the alternator puts out 14V just fine if it Owner drove it like this for over a YEAR but now wants to get it addressed because sometimes the Heated Seats and Steering Wheel refuse to turn ON Also the Fancy AIR SUSPENSION System has a MALFUNCTION and is disabled not good
This Range Rover came to me with a few problems On this video I will be looking at why the ESP and the HDC lights are ON on the dash which puts the entire suspension and 4x4 systems inoperative In the end one simple fix fixed them all
Bernie visits a local shop to help diagnose and fine the cuase of an engine misfire on a 2018 Honda Accord with a Turbocharged liter engine The fault code P0304 freeze frame data shows a misfire at light load at about 3800 RPM Freeze frame data is integral to this diagnosis showing when the misfire occured and possible causes Next live data points Bernie toward a fuel injector issue it showed short and long term fuel trim taking away fuel with a total fuel trim of Bernie uses eCOP ignition pickups to analuyze ignition waveforms identifying carbon tracing on the spark plugs This leaves Bernie having to find the cause of the carbon tracing on the spark plugs This particular Honda engine has coil fired GDI fuel inejctors so they can be drop tested like port style fuel injectors Bernie uses his eS COPE to activate the injectors to test fuel pressure drop and faulty drop amounts are found The vehicle will need new fuel injectors as well as new spark plugs due to carbon tracing to remedy this misfire
is your Ford Escape making a whining sound you can hear it here at audible too like almost a gurgling type whining sound that is a transmission pump you may also have poor engagement like where it quits moving on you or it slow from a stop the RPMs might rev up I might have a wrench light check engine light incorrect gear ratio codes oh I losing engagement right now oh yeah it slipping in for the forward clutch is slipping from low line pressure
I have a 2006 Ford P71 which I fixed the transmission A Ford 4R75E for loss of 3rd and Overdrive myself That was probably an issue with an internal pressure loss due to the factory valve body parts wearing out or sticking Or the weld for the forward clutch drum used for 1st 2nd and 3rd only broke a quarter or halfway around and resulted in a slipping forward symptom which would eventually burn the forward frictions down and lose all engagement
This Is What a Blown Jetta Transmission Sounds Like
