The fault code P0304 freeze frame data shows a misfire at light load at about 3800 RPM. Freeze frame data is integral to this diagnosis, showing when the misfire occured and possible causes. Next, live data points Bernie toward a fuel injector issue, it showed short and long term fuel trim taking away fuel, with a total fuel trim of -17.9%. Bernie uses eCOP ignition pickups to analuyze ignition waveforms, identifying carbon tracing on the spark plugs. This leaves Bernie having to find the cause of the carbon tracing on the spark plugs. This particular Honda engine has coil fired GDI fuel inejctors, so they can be drop tested like port style fuel injectors. Bernie uses his eS COPE to activate the injectors to test fuel pressure drop and faulty drop amounts are found. The vehicle will need new fuel injectors as well as new spark plugs (due to carbon tracing) to remedy this misfire.\",\n",
