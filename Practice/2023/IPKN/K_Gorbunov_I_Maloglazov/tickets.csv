i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked  is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give me more information about the recipient  that xxxx my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that  the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team  i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for 

i called xxxx whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again 

when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter 

during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a  fast safe and easy way to send money  but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team",4,UserID16,Ticket17,FinanceDepartment,FinanceDepartment,SVMClassifier

they do include a method to opt out but have no additional information about the consequences  many other people ive seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out  and even more egregiously despite chase simply sending an email doing this they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out

according to the last customer representative that i spoke with that night they had to send an email to a different department and that i could follow up with them the following week by tuesday or wednesday as they would have processed my cancelation by then unfortunately it is extremely difficult if not impossible to be calling from overseas and be on the phone with the credit card company for hours i had to authorize my husband to follow up on my behalf the following week before his upcoming trip overseas as he had to leave on xxxxxxxx which was our original plan 


my husband called them few times and went through the same process of being on the phone for hours either being on hold or being transferred to different departments he spoke with the main customer service the benefits and the chase travel initially a representative advised him to contact xxxx  directly to cancel my ticket finally after further research the same representative that he spoke to in the benefit department told him that we should expect to receive a credit because of the death in the family the representative assigned us a case number and told my husband that chase would get the refund from xxxx on our behalf according to him all we needed was a death certificate since we were both expected to be out of the country for few weeks the representative told my husband that the credit could be processed anytime upon our return or soon after the chase received the death certificate from us 

in xxxx while still overseas i received an email on xxxx xxxx from xxxx in chase travel who was following up with the death certificate i emailed chase travel department the scanned copy of the death certificate as soon as it became available to me i even emailed them a translation of the death certificate which was neither required by chase or xxxx i sent it to xxxx who had contacted me on xxxx xxxx by responding to her email from xxxx xxxx and then forwarded it again to her to make sure that they received it for personal and family reasons i ended up staying a little longer than expected and retuned to the united states on xxxx there was still no acknowledgment from xxxx or anyone from chase travel or any other department acknowledging the receipt of my email from xxxx or any other update soon after my return i had to send the travel department my father s death certificate for the third time and even tried to follow up with a phone call i also tried to send them an email on xxxxxxxx expressing my disappointment and requesting an update i also tried to correspond with chase customer service and chase travel through my online chase account 

chase travel finally responded with an acknowledgement through an email that they had received and located the death certificate that i had sent them the email was from xxxx one of the travel consultant supervisor for chase travel according to her they had forwarded the death certificate to xxxx she apologized for my experience with them and also asked me to disregard any other emails from them requesting documentation during this whole ordeal with chase i had contacted xxxx numerous times and spoke to different representatives according to xxxx in order for chase to process my credit they didnt need to forward the death certificate to xxxx 

in one of my initials calls to chase after my return to the united states i found out that the case number  reference number assigned to us and given to my husband by the by chase benefits department in xxxx could not be used as a reference because i was told that it did not exist in their system in xxxx and xxxx i spoke to several people and few supervisors hoping that they could resolve my issue customer service agents who seemed willing to help did not have the authority to resolve my issue as there was no outcome and i ended up wasting several hours without any resolution in sight 

there was one supervisor in chase travel department which was probably being managed by xxxx named xxxx whom i ended up speaking with twice during our brief conversation she flatly refused to help me or answer any questions she had the most condescending attitude that i have ever experienced from an agent affiliated with any company she refused to give me an update or call xxxx she refused to transfer me to her manager or anyone that could assist me to top it all she told me i needed a proof that i was related to the deceased which was contrary to what i had been told up till that point that all i needed was a death certificate i called xxxx and according to them a proof of relationship was not necessary or required xxxx told me that it was their policy that all that was needed was a death certificate and chase should have processed my credit as soon as they received it 

in xxxx i emailed and i called chase few times and each time i was promised that a supervisor would get back to me which never happened one of the last representatives that that i spoke with was on xxxx xxxx who was from chase benefits department to my utter shock and surprise he told me that they didnt have any type of claim for me on file i was beyond hope at that point he then transferred me once again to their travel department the representative there told me that they were still waiting to hear from xxxx i requested to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would be two hours before i could speak with one she promised that a supervisor would call me back but as always i never heard from anyone 

after several weeks on the phone with chase and after speaking to xxxx multiple times who repeatedly told me that the delay was from chase i finally decided that i would wait and see if the issue would be resolved today is xxxxxxxx and chase has still not processed my credit and followed up or called back in response to any of my previous phone calls even when they promised that i would receive a phone call 

i have finally decided that i am going to file a formal complaint with every private state and federal consumer protection agency or organization i would share my experience on any relevant online or offline forums available to me i have been a great customer i may have been frustrated with my experience but have always been respectful in my communications with chase or its representatives i have been managing my credit responsibly over the years had several premium credit card offers as i had met their criteria to apply for their cards with similar benefits as chase sapphire i decided to go with chase and was hopeful that i would take advantage of their travel benefits i spent thousands of dollars using my chase card even though some of my other cards also offered attractive benefits 

as stated earlier i fulfilled my obligation of using credit responsibly and of paying my bills chase on the other hand failed to issue me a credit and fulfill its promise a timely credit under the circumstances was my right it was according to and within the rules set by both the chase and xxxx airlines unfortunately i was never able to utilize the points that i had accumulated a credit card company at the very least should treat every customer with respect follow their own rules keep their promises and follow up with their customers and if required and within the rules be its customer s adovocate on his or her behalf when dealing with third parties i feel that chase fell short of these basic standards and expectations it with deep regret that i have to reconsider my business relationship with them it is a shame that a well known company like chase offering a premium card such as chase sapphire and charging a  xxxx yearly membership fee for it would have such a poor service it is either a case of extreme mismanagement by chase or a system deliberately designed in such a way that it only benefits the company at the expense of its customers",1,UserID78,Ticket79,TechnicalDepartment,TechnicalDepartment,SVMClassifier

the original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below 

my laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination i immediately disputed the transactions as soon as i got a notificationi filed the complaint within an hour of getting notification that flights have been booked on my credit card chase was extremely slow to respond and didnt do due diligence and contact the airline right away to cancel the flight and get me a refund 
chase did a very poor job at investigating the incident and put the charges back on my credit card without doing a proper investigation when i asked i was told that i benefited from the transactions clearly i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination later the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop proof that the flights were booked under my name however the date of births used to book the flights were not mine clearly i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to 
the way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes 
i am over that but this complaint i am filing is not about the original claimplease read below about this complaint 

please read this carefully 

after this incident i contacted xxxx and inquired about the flight they told me that they found too bookings for the same person headed to the same destination from two destinations and cancelled one of the bookings and issued a refund chase has not contacted xxxx once to resolve this issue xxxx has confirmed several times that they have issued me a refund and the money has been transferred to my bank account however chase hasnt issued me a refund whenever i contact chase they give me same old response the case has been closed i am not opening the same claim its a new complaint xxxx has issued me a refund and it hasnt been given to me by chase xxxx s customer service can not connect me to the accounting team and therefore it not possible for me to find the transaction and detailsthis is chase banks job connect with them and find out whats going on instead chase is asking me to contact xxxx and prove that the refund has been issued xxxx is telling me to have my bank contact their accounting department because its a banks job to resolve this issuesnow i am filing a new complaint demanding my money with interest and all the time chase has wasted 
i am attaching the documents that xxxx has provided me chase has asked me to provide these documents its chase s job but i am doing this ob their behalf 

xxxx is clearly stating that the bank has the funds they have also provided me a document showing that transaction details that the refund was applied to my account

50,"i purchased tickets  using my xxxx xxxx xxxx chase credit card  for my family of four and my two parents to go overseas from the us to xxxx for the first time last fall i purchased through a discount airline  xxxx  as it would not have been financially possible with another carrier our tickets were round trip not purchased as individual one way fares four tickets were purchased for my family on xxxxxxxx  and my parents tickets were purchased xxxxxxxx all six of us flew from the us xxxxxxxx my family of four were set to return xxxxxxxx with my parents set to return xxxxxxxx 

as xxxx airlines began experiencing financial difficulties they started changing and cancelling flights my return was cancelled because my flight from xxxx to xxxx wasnt being flown i was told by xxxx if i could get to xxxx on another airline i could catch a flight from xxxx back to the us with xxxx needing to get back to work as a teacher i booked flights from xxxx to xxxx at my own expense two days later xxxx failed altogether my new tickets to xxxx were now worthless as xxxx could no longer able to get me back to the us and no other carriers had flights to my destination 

because of this i was forced to buy new tickets from xxxx to the us on united airlines for all passengers obviously this caused some serious stress throughout our trip and also some serious financial strain that was unexpected the return flight i purchased were as much as the round trip tickets i had originally purchased on wow so my airfare essentially doubled 

upon contacting chase when i got home i was told that i would only partially be refunded because i was provided partial service the customer service representative and supervisor  both of which were friendly  equated it to buying a pair of pants and a shirt if the pants were not acceptable i still have to pay for the shirt my contention is a little different i purchased round trip tickets all part of the same trip the service i purchased was to get me to my destination and get me back to my origin all as one transaction 

i was not left in a better position by being flown across the world and left with not so much as an email from xxxx that they were closing i incurred additional flight lodging food etc my questions for the representatives were simple but with no adequate responses 

if i buy a flight with a connection if i am flown to the connecting city but not flown to my destination is this considered a service should i have to pay for part of a flight 
if i pay someone to put on a new roof and they tear it off but dont put new shingles back on do i have to pay for partial service 

in both of these cases just like my case we were not left in a better position we were most definitely left in a much worse position if xxxx was still in business i would be asking them for a complete refund and if that did not work i would be suing them for damages according to xxxx xxxx xxxx which would have applied if they were still in business i would have been entitled to xxxx euros per flight for the original cancellation of my return as well as the cancellation of the rescheduled flight they would also be liable for lodging new flights booked food etc in total this would add up to literally  xxxx 

yet i am being told by chase that xxxx in some way provided me something for which i should be grateful enough to pay of the original in actuality it seems much more likely that chase is not willing to take on this liability since xxxx is not here anymore to refund me the money however this is why i use my credit card to make these purchases consumer protection

the day i closed the office i went up to my chase branch and spoke to my banking contact xxxx xxxx i told him i had left and the physical office was closed i explained that the bookkeeper was taking over i informed him i was no longer a signatory on checks and she had the card in her possession 
some time in xxxx i contacted xxxx on a personal banking matter and when my leaving was referenced he claimed he had no idea and denied i ever came to see him not sure why perhaps he genuinely forgot i asked him if the card needed to be closed but he was rather argumentative he said he would take care of it he contacted xxxx xxxx that resulted in the following email exchange that you will see below

on xxxxxxxx xxxx called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the chase recovery and loan specialist department who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation i was seeking 

on xxxxxxxx i contacted the loan specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the loan numbers amounts and cosigner i asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans  drop off as soon as they are cancelled  a statement that is absolutely false i requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue the contract was post marked xxxxxxxx and arrived xxxxxxxx however the contract she sent was not the correct loan contract it was not the correct dates amount or loan number

realizing that i wasnt getting anywhere my cosigner contacted chase on xxxxxxxx attempting to get the information i requested the man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts referred her to the irs for further questions 

on xxxxxxxx my cosigner again contacted chase to directly request contract copies for these loans on this phone call she was told she was not a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts 

on xxxxxxxx i contacted chase again and spoke to loan specialist   xxxx who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans she said the original loans were taken out between xxxx she said loans were charged off xxxxxxxx letters sent in xxxx and reported cancelled in xxxx this time she could not confirm the address the s were sent to she said she had no idea where the address came from  she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports  she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to  fix  the non reported loans  i declined  she said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the s for these loans to be sent to me in business days unfortunately the only documentation she sent were s with the wrong address i have still yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts

it has been months numerous phones calls and misinformation and i can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility i once again called chase on xxxxxxxx and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans i was transferred to a voicemail left a very specific message with appropriate contact information and i have yet to receive a phone call back as of xxxxxxxx even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within business hours",2,UserID178,Ticket179,TrashDepartment,TrashDepartment,LogRegClassifier

if that is the case then chase should have had an upfront notice stating  you are aware that scam artists and pirates prefer xxxx because theres no recourse after they get your money and chase doesnt care  

ive done a lot of research on xxxx since getting scammed and i think it is bs that chase chose to partner with xxxx the number one tool used by scam artists because theres basically no verification required to set up an account and that chase promotes it as their own internal payment system giving the illusion id be afforded the same protections i get with the other chase family of products

having previous chase credit card products i was able to log into my online account and setup automatic bill payment for my account i used my card as needed to earn the companion pass and bonus points and assumed the auto payments were being made from my checking account as i viewed line items that had chase in the description and as i was not receiving paper statementsemails or phone calls from chase regarding my xxxx account 

in reviewing my checking account statement in xxxx and realizing the that the chase line item was actually an auto payment for one of my husbands credit cards and was not in fact for the xxxx visa card i reached out to chase xxxx visa immediately 

on xxxxxxxx i reached out to the customer service phone number listed on the back of my card  payments are due on the xxxx of the month  to learn that i was days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect 

additionally i learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information i had provided at the time of application 

i made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future 

they made notation in the account of the challenge reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late payment would not be reported to the credit bureau due to the banking error also confirmed that i had met the required spend to earn the bonus and given the banking error reversal of late charges payment in full and notation that i would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which i have received this reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end 

all subsequent payments have been made on time and as of xxxxxxxx the account has a balance due to charges made after payment in full 

in xxxxxxxx i received an email from xxxx alert service that i subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from xxxx to xxxx i opened the xxxx file which stated a late payment was reported by chase for xxxx i filed a dispute and in xxxx received an email from xxxx  stating the dispute had been resolved upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed 

i contacted chase xxxx visa explained the negative reporting the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges they stated that the  credit bureau unit  was not currently open and requested i call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information 

i followed the advice and spoke with xxxx cbu specialist in the xxxx mo call center after a long period of discussion xxxx informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau 

after requesting all notation on my file he advised i send a fax to the  business office  at  xxxx  xxxx but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that i could send the request to 

i asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to xxxx customer service 

in speaking with xxxx in customer service i believed that i was still speaking to the credit bureau department i recalled all events she confirmed the notation in the account additionally i advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on xxxxxxxx my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all chase accounts i was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account i received a screen that stated that i needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbersemail that were prepopulated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information i had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once i was able to gain access into the account i confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the default contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information 

i explained to her that when i tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account she assisted with updating on her end had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information 

given all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup i asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting at this point she advised me that i had been transferred out of the credit bureau department and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done i explained that i had already spoken with xxxx in that department and that i was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her she stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to days to provide a call back 

she then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named xxxx explained the situation and xxxx told her that there  was nothing that he could do to assist  

i have never been late with a payment across all accounts i have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with jp morgan chasexxxx as a result of chasexxxx xxxx it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment  provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that i will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from  outstanding  to  good  and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered

what is deception this communication portends several issues from my perspective  first there is a matter of dubious candor as articulated in the plain language of california civ which articulate the following  civil codeciv division obligations   part enacted one who willfully deceives  another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers 
a deceit within the meaning of the last section is either  the suggestion as a fact of that which is not true by one who does not believe it to be true  the assertion as a fact of that which is not true by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true  the suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact  or a promise made without any intention of performing it

the sole and exclusive disclaimer made by the agents of chase which appears to countervails us c a   a  is the following statement  ms xxxx as an agent for jp morgan chase lied when she stated to me and my wife that  jp morgan chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering loan terms and interest rate to me and my wife 

she lied when she presented to me and my wife that jp morgan chase selection of the lowest fico score was due to chases guideline  s  policy 

when we asked for a copy of chases guidelines she and her manager mr xxxx lied when they stated that jp morgan chase guidelines are internal documents and are not given out 

when ms xxxx tried to cover ms xxxx lie xxxx xxxx instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because chase does meet their competitors pricing and interest rate however when we submitted a written quote from a competitor mr xxxx in support of ms xxxx stated in an email communication that chase does not meet competitors pricing and since we had not provided a good faith fee and did not submit all documentation  we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the xxxx fico score and pricing or cancel the process 

ms xxxx email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors pricinginterest rate using a xxxx fico score as ms xxxx instructed us to do with the words where did you get this from never addressing that fact that the interest rate quoted was and we did what she asked of us

ms xxxx was asked not to load any of the cost into the loan she did it anyway and when asked several times to update the loan amount she did not complete that task until friday xxxx xxxx evening when she was on her way out the door for the week 

ms xxxx lied when she sent me the initial myhomechase email to login andor create login credentials in order to begin the process ms xxxx failed to provide me with the loan application number when my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the hours account creation expired ms xxxx stated that she did not provide the loan application number because she wanted me to give her a call when i discovered that i could not move forward 

it was during my wife phone conference with executive director mr xxxx xxxx on friday xxxxxxxx at xxxx that he confirmed the lies that ms xxxx represented on behalf of chase it was disclosed that chase does uses the middle fico score not the lowest it was also disclosed that chase did not have any such guideline  s  policy of using the lowest fico score as previously represented to us by ms xxxx xxxx it was disclosed that ms xxxx did not years of experience as a home loan advisor with chase mr xxxx further confirmed that ms xxxx has worked for chase for several years as a teller along with assisting other loan advisors i believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that ms xxxx has worked on alone 

mr xxxx in good faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to chases xxxx location but my wife decided to give ms xxxx the benefitofthe doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process 
i believe mr xxxx xxxx stated to my wife that he had a conversation with ms xxxx regarding the issues 

however it was a big mistake to leave ms xxxx in place it also appears that the conversation that mr xxxx had with ms xxxx did not work 
throughout friday xxxxxxxx late afternoon ms xxxx sent me several misleading emails informing me that my loan documents were ready for me to login to myhomechase to complete the loan application process and to paid the good faith fee 

i emailed her to alert her that the documents had not been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents she then sent me another email late friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents i waited for i believe hours and i emailed her back to share with her that i had not received the separate email later in the afternoonearly evening my wife placed a call to her her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a nice weekend 

shortly after that the separate email arrived i login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the old documents i email ms xxxx back with both mr xxxx  mr xxxx on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting ms xxxx with hanging the revised documents neither mr xxxx nor mr xxxx responded 

however ms xxxx did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on monday and that the only thing she did was to change the loan amount 
she went on to let me know that mr xxxx nor mr xxxx could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a nice weekend 

in conclusion as far as i am concerned all of the above behavior is a clear representation of unfair business practices and fraudulent business practices which my last email on friday xxxx xxxx that mr xxxx responded back to and forward to his executive office clearly reflects my disdained for being subjected to  ms xxxx and mr xxxx fraudulent and unlawful conduct",2,UserID262,Ticket263,TrashDepartment,TrashDepartment,LogRegClassifier
132,"ive been actively trying to resolve this concern with chase bank for the longest time since i was reported late days twice on my credit report due to no fault of my own 

i have spoke and confirmed this with a chase representative who agreed with me the system chase uses is false and leads to misinformation regarding accounts 

the chase system does not show correct account activity when payments are made to their auto loan accounts until the entire balance is processed on its own 

since the beginning of the lease ive had nothing but trouble trying to have my payments made and processed through chase without being charged some late fee when my payments are made on time 

back in xxxx i noticed the payments i had been sending to chase for my car were not being reflected on the balance my car payment due is each month if i submit a payment for that payment does not get applied to the balance whatsoever it will still reflect an amount of instead of thats is owed which is misleading and completely not fair 

it leads me to not know exactly how much is due after processing payments because even under recent activity it does not show the past payments ive made on the account only payments ive made months prior show up and not recent made payments 

its not fair chase does not apply the amounts ive paid to my car to help show the right balance due on my car this purposely misleads customers like me and we end up being penalized for not paying when weve processed multiple payments to our loan 

i should have not been reported late days for a past due balance of when i had made those payments and if chase updated the balances correctly customers such as myself would not have been reported late 

im kindly asking for chase to review and kindly update my credit report to reflect good standing due to bank errors that dont seem to get resolved",2,UserID264,Ticket265,TrashDepartment,TrashDepartment,LogRegClassifier

briefly summarizing my case i booked a flight ticket on xxxxxxxx for from my chase freedom unlimited cardi was about to checkin for the flight on xxxxxxxx from xxxx to xxxx xxxx when i get to know that the ticket was no longer valid as the transaction was cancelled by the bank 

i went to my nearest chase bank and the banker named xxxx xxxx tried helping me out with the problem by making a few calls after being on the call for about hours we get to learn that someone from the fraud department marked the transaction as fraud and it was then cancelled firstly i never reported the transaction as fraud and i didnt receive any messagecallnotification about this from the bank asking me whether i made the transaction or not secondly i didnt even receive any refund back for months until i called and asked them about it there was no way for me to know about this incident except the day before boarding the flight i had no other option than to book another flight which of course was at a much higher price of so after months since i first booked the ticket and many long hours of back and forth calls between the departments i finally did get the back as a refund which i appreciate but i really feel that none of this was my mistake as a transaction was cancelled without even my consent or letting me know in advance so why should i be bearing a loss of i dont think its right to just cancel transactions from a card by marking them fraud without first talking to the customer about it 

i emailed the same to the ceo mr xxxx xxxx on xxxxxxxx and received a call back from his department after reviewing my case and going through the details i was refused any compensation saying that the bank has the right to cancel any transaction they want whenever they want this makes me feel less reliable on chase credit cards now and i feel its not the right way to treat the customers i already cancelled one of the card and stopped depositing my paychecks thanks to this unsatisfactory experience i think more people should hear about my story and be more cautious before using chase cards for important transactions",1,UserID268,Ticket269,TechnicalDepartment,TechnicalDepartment,SVMClassifier

149,"i am appalled at this situation with chase i have spent over months now trying to get this issue resolved at this point ive exhausted my options to resolve the issue on my own and chase has not done anything to facilitate the issue 

my chase checking account had three fraudulent actions on xxxxxxxx there were two credit transactions for and with description xxxx xxxx trialcredt on xxxxxxxx there was a debit of with description xxxx xxxxt newaccount 

we were on vacation that week and werent actively monitoring our transactions we were on a xxxx xxxx out of xxxx xxxx we departed on xxxxxxxx and returned on xxxxxxxx on xxxxxxxx we were reviewing our finances on xxxx and noticed these three charges at first i contacted xxxx to see if they had an account opened in my name  maybe i made a mistake and didnt recognize the chargeaccount they had no accounts opened under myself or my wife so said i needed to work with my own bank s fraud department so that they can resolve i contacted chase to alert them that these were unauthorized fraudulent charges i was told it would be taken care of without issue and a temporary credit would be issued for the i explained my thesis  the two credits were done to  verify  the account at xxxx and once done they were able to deduct the later on i was told i was absolutely correct 

on about xxxx  theres no notice or letter on the site but chase can verify the date  i received a letter in the mail stating that my  claim  was denied and the was going to be removed from my account i immediately called chase to ask why and they indicated they had not received the letter back  attached  which required   review the transactions you are disputing and thoroughly answer all of the questions  sign the form and  return it by the date above to avoid a delay or denial of temporary credit 

i told them that i had not received the letter or maybe i overlooked it as an account disclosure as it wasnt obvious to me that i needed to do anything further after initially reporting the fraudulent charges i went to the bank branch to expedite the process of getting the forms signed and the banker said she faxed the forms i sent them back the signed forms and a separate letter detailing what had occurred  i dont have a copy of it but its basically everything ive written so far  part of their denial was related to the two  credit  transactions which they had not included in the original claim i said i had noted that those were fraudulent previously 

i called about a week later and they said that the original claim was still denied i asked if they had received the signed letter to which they replied  no  i went back to the bank branch and signed the form again i took the form and faxed it along with my explanation letter on xxxx which they then opened a new claim for the two  credit  transactions the  credit  transactions of total were removed from my account 

there have been numerous phone calls to chase in between looking for status updates and it basically went unreviewed for about a month in the process chase indicated theres a day window to request funds back from a merchant i said i reported it within that time to chase i pleaded with them to call xxxx xxxx  they said they cant make outgoing phone calls are you kidding me after about a month one time when i called again and they said that the claim was denied because the  courtesy credit  was submitted late because they didnt have the forms  although they reopened as a courtesy to me on xxxx  but that the merchant denied after two separate requests 

they lied they said i would need to reach out to  the merchant   which is a bank i called xxxx direct again and explained my situation they couldnt be kinder and more understanding they again verified that they dont have accounts opened in my or my wife s name however i explained the situation and their fraud department looked up the transaction using my chase account number and the amounts the agent validated that the account those funds had gone and come from and the account had been flagged as fraudulent and frozen they say saw the  trialcredits  were sent back to their institution but that there was no record of the being claimed by chase as fraud they said the money is sitting in the account at xxxx and chase just needs to submit the claim and theyll return as a regulatory requirement theyll honor those requests for up to a year so after further questions to chase it turns out my  requests were denied  by chase s research department not the merchant  hence the lie  ive given more than enough information to explain the situation and they took forever to basically ignore 

i called chase back and they said theyd escalate again given the circumstances i called on tuesday xxxxxxxx and they said i could call back in business days to see if theres a resolution they dont have the courtesy or ability to call me i called on thursday xxxxxxxx and they said  did a supervisor call you  to which i replied  no they said i needed to call to get an update  they replied  well it will take business days so try back later  

here s the deal  i had three fraudulent transactions that i reported to chase in less than two months after occurring they have not claimed the funds even though they were unauthorized fraudulent charges ive spent countless hours on the phone explaining the case providing information even contacting the other bank who told me what chase needed to do in the end this feels like im being taken advantage from as i am the one liable for the unauthorized ach transaction im pretty sure theres a regulatory requirement against that",4,UserID298,Ticket299,FinanceDepartment,FinanceDepartment,SVMClassifier

the problem only got much worse when xxxx repeatedly asked for an updated medical document from my physician s office to which i complied and then they asked for an updated medical document with a fancy signature and a stamp  and another one with nicer handwriting to the point where they were just beating around the bush to hope the situation drops its clear to see they  dont want to comply with the situation because they would be losing money on the ticket sale hence the repeated use of asking for new medical documentation 

xxxx s clause of  did you attempt to reach out for refunds or credits  is an absolute joke because clearly i did and have provided the documents ad nauseum but the third party here is avoiding the situation to not lose their profit this travel insurer shouldve stepped in and solved the issue directly by providing a refund for the airfare based on the travel agent s reluctance to cooperate given the excessive requests when the claims examiner makes useless statements like   after all sir we are just a secondary travel insurance provider and theres nothing we can really do  is an insult equivalent to rubbing salt in the wound way to be more of the problem than the solution

what also has rubbed me the wrong was is why chase is not asking me to fill out an affidavit or provide them with a police report if they are not sure if the charge is not valid they should have asked for this information lying on a police report is a class a misdemeanor you should have asked for a police report before making a decision the importance of doing that is discussed here https  xxxx what also worries me is i did not physically make that purchase and it was just charged to my credit card i dont know how my bank can be okay with a charge being applied to my credit card when i did not make a purchase for that charge so chase is expecting me to pay dollars for no merchandise which is unacceptable this is why i am mad they are forcing me to pay for an item that i never bought and there is an unauthorized charge

224,"i purchased my home through chase mortgage in as a first time homebuyer on an escrow payment of was applied directly to the escrow account going forward the original agreement signed in good faith indicated of the monthly payment would go towards the escrow account to cover insurance and property taxes i set up an auto pay for so additional principal would also be applied these amounts were paid and applied appropriately until the payment on where the escrow payment applied was dropped to down from the to continue paying the insurance but not the property taxes without my knowledge or consent i was confused and unsure as to why this happened but being a firsttime homebuyer assumed that because the previous home owner had a homestead exemption that granted him complete exemption from property taxes the taxes may have been reassessed and with already almost in the escrow account the monthly amount withdrawn could now be reduced believing the bank would apply funds as necessary i did not change my automatic payment  i continued the autopay that was set up to pay the monthly mortgage amount dictated by the bank plus the additional principal 

recently i noticed a message on my online chase mortgage account that indicating my monthly payment would be changed once again but this time from to it appears that because the bank failed to continue applying escrow towards the property taxes they are now unfairly demanding that i double up on tax payments this year to clear last year s property taxes and put money into escrow for this year s property taxes of the payment it appears they are applying towards  escrow shortage   short due to the bank s error   and towards property taxes as you can imagine nearly doubling the monthly payment on a mortgage would no doubt create a severe financial hardship on a single mother i feel the bank was misleading and deceptive in their erroneous practice of changing the monthly payment without my consent and then expecting me to pay twice the amount in property to make up for their mistake",2,UserID448,Ticket449,TrashDepartment,TrashDepartment,SequentialClassifier

257,"on xxxxxxxx i purchased a bluetooh headphone in xxxx xxxx s inflight store as i traveled on one of their planes i received the item near the end of the flight as passengers were disembarking which was not an issue as i was not planning on using it while on the flight anyways 

upon returning home and opening the item i discovered that it was defective such as headphones not connecting sound only coming out of one or the other ear sound having lots of static these issues were consistent when using the headphone on multiple devices 

i attempted to reach out to the merchant but from my research my understanding is that the airline is based in xxxx and their main call center is in xxxx i endured long wait times  minutes  hour  and got xxxx speaking representatives i would have to hang up and call again to try and reach an english speaking representative when i finally got in touch with one i was simply told that their policy does not allow returns 

this is in contrast to us consumer protection laws and visa s card processing guidelines clearly in xxxx a costumer should be able to receive a refund for a purchased item that is defective 

it is under these circumstances that i reached out to chase and initiated a dispute i gave them the same explanation and context that i had made multiple attempts to work with the merchant and was not given a resolution 

a summary of the next events  xxxxxxxx  chase digitally sends a letter from the merchant with an email address and xxxx phone number for me to contact them for resolution i was told this letter would be under my statements but did not find it there 

around xxxx  xxxx a chase representative gets back in touch with me and ask me to try looking for the letter in different areas of their website after trying several different areas of the website i found the letter i explained my concern that i had already tried calling the merchant and did not get a resolution i asked if the merchant does not respond does that give me grounds to continue with the dispute and if so what is the last date to continue the dispute xxxx answered affirmatively that certainly if the merchant is nonresponsive then we can continue with the dispute with the deadline being xxxxxxxx 

xxxxxxxx  i email the merchant at the email address provided to me and explain i am looking for a resolution the merchant does not reply 

xxxxxxxx  xxxx calls me again and i explain that the merchant has not replied to my email xxxx provides me with a chase email address to forward my email to her as evidence i comply with her request exactly as she states 

xxxxxxxx  today xxxx called me and informed me that she received the email i sent her that she requested however because i made this purchase inperson i had the opportunity to inspect the item and thus i did not have the right to dispute the charge 

that reasoning does not sound valid to me there are millions of inperson purchases each day especially with electronics even if you purchase it in person you may not be able to confirm that it is working if i purchase an video game console would i demand that the merchant allow me to connect it to their tv and electric outlet in order to test that it is in good working order in my case i made this purchase inflight near the end of the flight many times while in the air we are instructed to put our phones away and i had no intention of using this new item while on the flight i have never been instructed to verify the condition of an inpurchase item otherwise i would lose my right to a refund 

when i asked xxxx which specific chase policyguideline stated that i had to inspect an inperson purchase otherwise i would lose my right to a dispute she said it was not a chase policyguideline 

i then asked xxxx since it is not a chase policyguideline it must be a visa policy and asked her to identify which specific policy it is xxxx said she can not tell me which policy it is but that i am free to look it up myself 

this is contrary to every experience i have had with disputes banks are not prevented from telling their cardholders visa s policies as those are the policies that they must follow in fact the opposite is quite true banks must be transparent about the visa policies that they are beholden to and must follow 

it appears that perhaps a mistake was made by xxxx and after i provided her with the email she did not continue with the dispute as she should have now that the deadline is passed she is unable to continue the dispute and has to find a reason to reject my dispute 

under visa guidelines there are time limits to when a costumer can seek a dispute for a resolution i have worked with xxxx in good faith to resolve this and provided all the information she requested in the time frames she has requested them i have upheld my responsibilities as the cardholder and customer and xxxx while acting as chase s representative did not",4,UserID514,Ticket515,FinanceDepartment,FinanceDepartment,LogRegClassifier
